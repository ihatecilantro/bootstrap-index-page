[IHateCilantro.com](http://www.ihatecilantro.com) is a community of members in support of each other and their loathing of the devil soap weed!

Together we can make the community great.

This repo is designed to allow collaboration on the design of the IHateCilantro.com website and contains a static version of the index page with related support files in a corresponding directory structure.

Staff will update the repo with changes as the interns will from time to time rouse themselves from indefinite slumber to push buttons seemingly at random in a hypnogogic state before once again slumping onto the floor in blissful and exasperating dormancy.

**Our design goal for this project is to utilize native or packaged [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) elements and classes as much as possible.** We would like to keep custom coded javascript & css to a minimum.

*Please fork & submit pull requests at will.*

Post to the wiki and email us. The staff at IHC fully support you supporting us supporting the community and are exceptionally grateful to you for your dedication and selflessness.

Thank you,
The staff @ IHateCilantro.com
