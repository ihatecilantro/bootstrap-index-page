[IHateCilantro.com](http://www.ihatecilantro.com) is a community of members in support of each other and their loathing of the devil soap weed!

From time to time the interns at IHC HQ will periodically rouse themselves from an indefinite slumber to a hypnogogic trance only to push buttons seemingly at random before once again slumping onto the floor in blissful and exasperating dormancy. But this isn't enough!

We need your help!

This repo is designed to allow collaboration on the design of the IHateCilantro.com website and contains a static version of the index page with related support files in a corresponding directory structure.


**Our design goal for this project is to utilize native or packaged [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) elements and classes as much as possible.** We would like to keep custom coded javascript & css to a minimum.

*Please fork & submit pull requests at will.*

Post to the wiki and email us with any questions or issues. The staff at IHC fully support you supporting us supporting the community and are exceptionally grateful to you for your dedication and selflessness.

Together we can make the community great!

Thank you,

The staff @ IHateCilantro.com
